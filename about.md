Hello! My name is Bryan Acosta, and I'm currently studying Computer Science in UMass Dartmouth.  
This blog will document mostly everything that I do, along with sharing information I've learned throughout the process of creating various things. I hope you will learn a thing or two, or at the very least enjoy observing a university student's journey to the great unknown!

I'd love to put more information here, but there's not much I can write about for the moment. I'll be sure to populate this page as I do more and more projects in the future and discover more things to write about!
