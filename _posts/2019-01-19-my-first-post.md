I've finally made my first blog post! It's been one hell of a struggle for me to decide what theme to pick for this blog -- the struggle mainly lied with choosing between the Minima theme, the BlackDoc theme, and the Carte Noire theme. Then I later found out how easy it is to customize themes, so I decided to tweak the Minima theme to look like the Carte Noire theme with a different color palette.

Through the creation of this website, I fully realized how bad Windows is to program various things, especially using the terminal. It was a _pain_ having to install Jekyll and Ruby on Windows, especially since dependencies had to be manually installed. It was so convoluted that I had to struggle for well over an hour, having to go through multiple tutorials.  
However, there was a docs page to easily install Jekyll in Ubuntu. Just some copying and pasting and I got Jekyll up and running. Night and day difference.

Anyway! Now that I have the site up and running, I'll definitely be posting on this site, hopefully frequently.
